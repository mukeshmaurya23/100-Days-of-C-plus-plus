What is using namespace std  in c++?
Answer:Lets first understand what is namespace in c++.
       Two variable with same name is not allowed in c++.so to overcome this problem we use namespace .
       namespace treat is as two different variable with different scope
    Example:
    namespace s1 
    {
        int a=10;
    }
    namespace s2
    {
        int a=20;
    }
    int main()
    {
        cout<<s1::a<<endl;
        cout<<s2::a<<endl;
        return 0;
    }
    using namespace std;
    (The functionality of cout and cin are in iostream header file under namespace std.
        if you dont write using namespace std then you have to write with std namespace and then cout
        Example :std::cout<<"Hello"<<endl;
        if you use using namespace std then you  have to write like this cout<<"Hello"<<endl;    
    )
